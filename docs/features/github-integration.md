metadata:
  name: my-backstage-portal
  annotations:
    # Links to GitHub repository
    github.com/project-slug: manik-dhristhi/my-portal
    
    # GitHub Actions workflows to track
    github.com/workflows: ci.yml,deploy.yml
    
    # Source location for additional context

## Best Practices

### Repository Structure
```
my-portal/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ catalog-info.yaml          # Backstage entity definition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mkdocs.yml                 # TechDocs configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/             # CI/CD pipeline definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                      # Documentation source
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                  # Project overview
```

### Entity Definition
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include comprehensive tags and labels
- Link related systems and dependencies
- Document APIs and interfaces

### Documentation
- Keep README files up to date
- Use TechDocs for comprehensive guides
- Include architecture diagrams
- Document deployment procedures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Repository not showing up in catalog:**
- Check GitHub token permissions
- Verify `catalog-info.yaml` syntax
- Ensure repository is accessible

**Issues tab not loading:**
- Confirm `github.com/project-slug` annotation
- Check GitHub API rate limits
- Verify token has `repo` or `public_repo` scope

**CI/CD status not updating:**
- Validate workflow file names in annotations
- Check workflow permissions and triggers
- Ensure workflows are enabled in repository settings

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test GitHub API access
curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" \
     https://api.github.com/repos/manik-dhristhi/my-portal

# Validate catalog entity
backstage-cli repo lint

# Check TechDocs build
backstage-cli repo build --all
```
